This is the starter kit for Java SDK.

This kit contains a simple web application that displays car information using Smartcar's Java SDK.

## Instructions
Before we get started, create an application on Smartcar's Developer Dashboard to get your API keys.

**Note:** On the dashboard, you will want to set your `redirect_uri` as `http://localhost:8000/callback`.

Then, we can set the clientId and clientSecret as enviromental variables -
```bash
$ export SMARTCAR_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
$ export SMARTCAR_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
```

Or we can set the clientId and clientSecret within `Main.java` -
```java
AuthClient client = new AuthClient.Builder()
                      .clientId("yourClientId")
                      .clientSecret("yourClientSecret")
                      .redirectUri("http://localhost:8000/callback")
                      .mode('test')
                      .build();
```

To install the required dependencies and run this Java app -
```bash
$ gradle run
```

Once your server is up and running, you can authenticate your vehicle. In our current set up, we are in Smartcar's [test mode](https://smartcar.com), so you can log in with any username and password. To authenticate, navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. Once you have authenticated, go to `http://localhost:8000/vehicle` to see your vehicle information.
